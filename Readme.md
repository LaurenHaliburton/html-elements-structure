# Instructions

## Part 1: HTML Elements and Structure

### Create a Detailed HTML Document:
- Create an `index.html` file.
- Add a basic HTML structure with the following elements:
  - A header with a main title (`<h1>`) and a navigation bar (`<nav>`) containing links (`<a>`).
  - A main section (`<main>`) with at least three sections (`<section>`), each containing a subtitle (`<h2>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).
  - A footer (`<footer>`) with some text.

## Part 2: Introduction to the PRE Tag

### Use the PRE Tag:
- In one of your sections, add a `<pre>` tag to display preformatted text.
- Include multiple lines of text with spaces and line breaks.

## Part 3: Review of the Box Model

### Create and Style a Box:
- Add a `<div>` element to one of your sections with some text inside it.
- Apply CSS styles to this `<div>` to demonstrate the box model, including:
  - width
  - height
  - padding
  - border
  - margin

### Explanation:
- View your styled `<div>` in a browser.

## Part 4: Browser Built-in Styles vs. Custom Styles

### Compare Styles:
- Add a paragraph to your HTML file and observe the default styles applied by the browser.
- Add custom CSS to override the default styles (e.g., change font size, color).
